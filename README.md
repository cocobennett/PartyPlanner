# PartyPlanner
An Application coded in Java on Feb 9, 2015 for Event Planning. 

This program started out as a class project for my CSC 2121 class at Tennessee Tech. I was intrigued by the assignment that I expanded on it and made it what you see here. There are many functionalities available, which are described in the Abstract and Video.

> To run, download the jar file and double-click to run.
